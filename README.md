# beginning_java
I will be using this after completing the courses on Team Treehouse. I have recently received a copy of 'Head Start Java' and will be starting shortly.

-The first program I built was a PEZ Dispenser that runs in the console which can be found in the folder pez_dispenser

-The second program I build was the game Hangman that also runs in the console
